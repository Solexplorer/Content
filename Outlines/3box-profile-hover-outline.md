## Motivation
 Profile hovers allow developers to easily replace hexadecimal addresses in their app's UI with user-friendly social profile information. This is like the ENS system but more centralized.
 Profile hovers make web3 apps more engaging by adding familiarity, social trust, and usability

## Who should read this
Anyone who wants to stop using hexadecimal addresses and want to give a nice UI instead of using solely ENS names.
The article will include code samples in JS and will require a moderate technical background.
