-   **Step 1**: input your Medium user profile or publication URL, and click 'GET ARTICLES'

    -   (1) Medium user profile (e.g. '<https://medium.com/@kauri_io'>)
    -   (2) Medium publication (e.g. '<https://blog.kauri.io'>)
    -   (3) Single Medium article (e.g. '<https://media.consensys.net/the-forgotten-side-of-decentralization-f713aaa8c8b4'>)

-   **Step 2**: select which articles you would like to import to draft on Kauri, and click 'IMPORT'

    -   the selected articles will then be imported, and once complete, can be viewed in Kauri in the 'My Draft' tab

-   **Step 3**: we highly suggest reviewing your imported draft articles via Kauri's 'preview' feature to ensure the article's HTML to Markdown conversion was completed successfully

-   **To publish**, once you've previewed your content and ensured the formatting is correct, simply click 'PUBLISH ARTICLE' located in the top right of the page

### Things to be aware of

-   The tool will import tweets and embedded youtube videos; if you use another video hosting service, such as vimeo, please update the links to your embedded videos in the Kauri editor when the article is in draft stage
-   Importing a large amount of articles can take up to 15-20 minutes
